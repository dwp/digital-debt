  <h1 class="heading-medium">To understand current behaviour around balance information and understanding of the concept of changing the deduction amount in the context of an on-benefit repayment journey & whether people would use such service.</h1>

<ul class="list list-bullet">
     <li>What the "balance" means in the context of the prototype?</li>
     <li>Do they need any more information than (current/original balance, end date, how you are repaying us) to make a decision as to what to do next?</li>
     <li>Do they understand that the deductions come out of their benefits?</li>
     <li>Do they understand what the next steps could be?</li>
     <li>Why would they reduce or increase the amount?</li>
     <li>What else do people need to know while changing the payments?</li>
     <li>How do they conceive the action based on what they need to do – e.g. for them is it about “changing the amount” (do they respond to this and how), or “missing a payment”, or “claiming hardship”</li>
     <li>How do people react to concept of hardship (if at all)?</li>
     <li>What would they expect to happen next? - Would they expect to be notified & how? What information they expect that notification to have?</li>
</ul>
